1998,"Mexico (Pacific)","Tijera and Mazunte, Oaxaca",16,-95,"In spring and summer 1998, when the anti-El Niño event was present in the eastern Pacific, corals remained in good condition in Oaxaca, although surface temperature was noticeably lower than normal, especially in May. However, after high wind intensities and coastal upwelling caused further sea surface temperature reductions during autumn 1998, we observed widespread bleaching in the reef tract, but mortality only occurred in the two most northern reefs of the area: Tijera and Mazunte. Pocillopora was the most affected genus, although Pavona and Porites were impacted, too. In normal years, northern winds cross the Gulf of México and increase their speed when passing through the Tehuantepec Isthmus. They displace surface water and produce strong upwellings that affect an area of about 200X500 km in the Gulf of Tehuantepec.","Reyes-Bonilla, et al 2002.

Bleaching is mild to moderate rather than severe; colonies are paling, and all shades of colour from normal to white are observed. In Kenya, most paling and bleaching is on upper surfaces, and the coincidence of high temperatures, calm conditions and spring low tides just prior to bleaching suggest combined effects of these factors rather than an overwhelming dominance of one.
The spatial extent of paling and bleaching amounts to perhaps 10-20% of coral cover and 5-25% or colonies, with most observations made in shallow inner-reef zones (water depth of 0.3-1m at MLW).  
Most detail on taxonomic incidence of bleaching has come from reports in Kenya, where the most affected genus is Pocillopora, where locally close to 100% of colonies have been observed bleached, and some colonies observed with dead patches (primarily around the branch tips). Interestingly, P. damicornis is less affected than other species, and in one shallow reef flat area is unaffected.

2010,"Trinidad and Tobago","Tobago reef",11,-60,"As a follow up to my pervious post on ""Coral bleaching and an unknown sponge disease in Tobago"", I returned to a monitoring site, surveyed only 10 dys earlier, and I to my dismay, within the 20-40ft depth area there is mass mortality of the Giant Barrel Sponges (Xestospongia muta).  Some of the other songes are also looking a bit poorly, but not to the extent of mortality.  Samples have been retrieved for analysis both heathy and unhealthy looking X. muta.  That said, even heathy looking sponges were snapping off at their bases.  There is also wide spread bleaching, especially at the 23-35ft depth at Speyside, affecting most species(Montastrea faviolata, Siderastrea sidera, S. radians, all Diplorias, M.
Anularis, Millipora, octocorals etc). Speyside's reefs are generally sponge
dominated, but the main reef building coral species are Montastrea
faveolata, Siderastrea sidera, Diploria spp. And Madracis mirabilis.  At
deeper depths, up to 60ft moderate bleaching was observed, and only of
particular species (Meandrina meandrities and Siderastrea sidera).  The
water temperature at this depth was quite warm, with temperature loggers
recording on the reefs at 30ft showing temperatures up to 31 deg C.
 Interestingly some resiliency studies/models indicate that the longer lived
and slower growing species, such as boulder corals (Montastreas and
Siderastrea) are more resilient that branching species (Porities and
Madracis), however very very little bleaching of M. mirabilis was observed.
 M. mirabilis can be found in extensive spreads in Speyside with octocorals,
sponges, boulder and brain corals inter-dispersed.

Thus far the north eastern side of the island is the only location I've been
able to follow up on, but I have received reports of increased bleaching
along the Caribbean coast and south west of the island.

This zone is constantly exposed to increases of temperature influenced by the diurnal contributions from the Juluapan Lagoon, from which influxes of water at 27,5 and 32.0 °C in winter and summer, respectively.
During the summer of 2004 (AprilJune) diving campaigns were undertaken to study the bleaching phenomenon in this zone.  Bleaching evaluations of Pocillopora capitata were conducted by assessing  the concentrations of chlorophyll a and total carotenoids from samples along submarine transect lines.
The coralline population at La Boquita is under a state of local thermal stress, which is a direct consequence of the inappropriate location of the artificial intercommunication structure of the Juluapan Lagoon, which could cause irreversible damage to the reef's productivity, adaptability and regeneration capacity.","Ms Angelica Flores Ramirez,  Universidad de Colima.","MEX","NONE"

Our first observations of pale corals was done in May in Akumal reef, with 7% of the colonies showing pale coloration at a depth of 10-15m. By June, 9% of the colonies were bleached-pale in Mahahual Reef at the same depth. By July, 32% of the colonies were bleached-pale in Punta Allen reef.

At present, (August-September) surveys at Puerto Morelos reef show that 41% of the colonies were bleached and 31% of them were completely white.
Surveys were done at a depth of 4-8m.

The number of colonies sampled at each site was over 2000. Almost all scleractinian species showed bleaching signs, as well as some gorgonians, Milleporas and zoanthids.","MC. Rosa Rodríguez-Martínez

2005,"Bahamas","San Salvador",23.9994,-74.5575,"During the week of November 20th, 2005, an Earthwatch Institute Research Team ""The Bahamian Reef Survey"" discovered a bleaching event in progress on patch reefs around San Salvador, Bahamas. The bleaching was evident primarily on Agaricia sp., Favia fragum, and Porites sp. (finger corals) - although Porites asteroids, had limited bleaching. Limited bleaching of Montastrea annularis was also observed; however, many coral heads of this species displayed significant blanching. Water quality testing showed physical and chemical parameters were within normal levels at the time.

The Bahamian Reef Survey has collected data since 1992, on the shallow patch reefs surrounding the Island. This bleaching event is the third bleaching event documented on San Salvador in that time period. Initially the data suggest that the bleaching event is similar to a 1995/96 bleaching event in both scope and affected species. While no proximal cause was found for the earlier event, it appears that higher than normal sea temperatures have been involved in precipitating this event.","John Rollino [John.Rollino@earthtech.com] in Coral list 12/1/2005","BHS","UNKNOWN"
2010,"Bahamas","San Salvador",24.1,-74.483333," Earthwatch Institute research-team conducted seasonal monitoring on shallow-water patch reefs on San Salvador Island, Bahamas. Results of the monitoring determined the majority Agaricia agaricites colonies were showing signs of bleaching - with many colonies exhibiting bleaching of greater than 75 percent. Also, as part of a reef restoration experiment, many Acropora palmata transplants suffered mortality since the project's last monitoring effort in July.  Prior to July, most of the transplants had survived over one year and had exhibited new tissue growth. Review of temperature logger data showed water temperatures >30C  in August. Finally, and somewhat curiously, much less algae was observed on the reefs than in previous monitoring efforts and large corals (e.g., Diploria sp., Montastrea sp., etc.) exhibited little, if any, ill effects.

Anecdotal reports from residents on the island indicated that air temperatures in August were the hottest that anyone could remember.
Also, for the last two months there have been excessive winds with the elevations of both high and low tides being far greater (and sustained) than anyone could ever remember","[Coral List ] : Rollino, John.  (Principal Investigator, Bahamian Reef Survey, Earthwatch

(north coast)",18.463,-77.947,"Sampled by snorkeling observation was the area of Drs Cave Beach westward to the spur and groove formations and drop to 10M depth, an area of approximately 200m (west) x50m (north) including shallow lagoon/patch reef, reef crest and spur and groove reef. The area has been sampled using REEFCHECK to contain between 16% and 21% live coral. <br>
Bleaching observed within shallow lagoon areas (<3M depth) behind reef and areas likely influenced by warm lagoon waters.<br>
This bleaching event is not as yet particularly intensive. It will be observed for change in the coming weeks.<br>
Water temperature was measured by Citizen wrist-mounted digital thermometer to be 31 degrees Celsius.<br>
Level and prominence of bleaching observed as follows:<br>
Millepora spp. (mainly complanata): Bleaching occurring in less then 50% of colonies. Bleaching intensity strong in less then 25% of cases.<br>
Montastrea annularis: Bleaching occurring in less then 20% of colonies. No colonies larger then 30cm diameter affected. Bleaching rarely (<10 of cases) more intense then simple fading of colour from uppermost area.<br>
Acropora cervicornis: Bleaching occurring on 70% of colonies observed; patchy, and mainly on upper surfaces of branch. Larger colonies (30CM diameter) more likely to be affected then small colonies and single branches. Bleaching accompanied by white band disease in four colonies. (A. cervicornis is relatively rare. <20 colonies observed total). <br>
Agaricia agaricites: Bleaching observed on colony ridges, patchy. Less then 20 individuals observed displaying notable bleaching in this locally common species.  <br>
Porites porites: Bleaching observed as fading of colour on upper faces of branches and growth tips in four colonies, all of the brown morph. This species and morph is common.<br>
Palythoa caribaeorum: one colony observed to be partially bleached, colours faded on its upper surface. This species is uncommon in this area. (< 10 colonies observed)<br>

2005,"Colombia","Islas del Rosario (National Natural Park)",10.167,-75.767,"A massive bleaching of corals is taking place since aprox 10-15 days (since late June) at Islas del Rosario (National Natural Park) near the city of Cartagena, Colombia. I was there on holidays during the weekend of 8-10 July and took many photos in shallow waters (down to 5 m) around the Oceanarium at San Martín de Pajarales Island (10°10'37.7""N-75°46'16.2""). Resident people had been noticing the bleaching since about 1-2 weeks before my arrival, associated with extremely warm, and possibly quite brackish waters (from nearby river discharges).<br>
Almost all corals were totally white to pale yellow. Some massive star coral colonies (Montastraea annularis and M. faveolata) still had slightly colored basal patches. Brain coral species (Diploria and Colpophyllia) were completely bleached. Porites porites beds were totally white. P. astreoides knobs were from white to light lemon yellow. Siderastrea siderea was less affected with a dark bluish-violet color in several colonies, and a few normally brown. S. radians was apparently not affected (hard to tell, the small encrustations of this species being normally so light). Even Favia fragum golfball corals were fully bleached. Benthic, rubble-dwelling anemones (probably corallymorpharians) were white. Millepora spp. had both white, normal and ""pinto"" (patchy) like colonies-branches. Did not see any Acropora to tell whether the few remaining colonies bleached or not.<br>

It seemed that deeper corals were less bleached. However, Jaime Rojas, biologist working for both the National Park authorities and the Oceanarium, undertook on July 8 a quick survey around the islands confirming that the phenomenon is widespread. He is making a follow up, and working with daily sea-surface temperature data (possibly salinity too) taken regularly at the Oceanarium. Later on he may make a more detailed report. <br> 
No sponges had bleached. Even brown encrusting Cliona, which harbor zooxanthellae, were fine. <br>

2005,"Colombia","Tayrona Natural National Park,  off the city of Santa Marta",11.333,-74.133,"Pale colonies of Montastraea annularis were first observed in
shallow waters (<10m) at Bahía de Nenguange on the 21st of October. A week later, most M. annularis colonies were bleached, showing the classic
bleaching pattern being more intense on top than on the sides, while
Colpophyllia natans colonies were pale. By the 11th of November the
bleaching event became more evident: nearly all colonies of M. annularis
and Porites porites were severely bleached, while most M. faveolata,
Diploria labyrinthiformis, Colpophyllia natans, Porites astreoides,
Siderastrea siderea, Millepora spp., and the zoanthid Palythoa
caribbaeorum were partially bleached. Similar observations were made in
coral reefs of Bahía de Taganga, adjacent to the TNNP, however, most P.
astreoides colonies were severely bleached in Taganga, in contrast to
Bahia de Neguange. <br>

It is interesting to note that corals at the TNNP bleached quite late
compared to other reef corals throughout the Caribbean [e.g. reefs at
Islas del Rosario, only 200 k southwest from the TNNP, bleached 4 months
earlier in late June (report by Sven Zea posted in coral list)]. This
might have some relation to the bi-modal seasonal upwelling that occurs in
the area, with upwelling peaks taking place early in the year and by
July-August. <br>

2005,"Venezuela","Cayo Sombrero (Morrocoy National Park, MNP Venezuela)",10.887,-68.221,"In Cayo Sombrero (Morrocoy National Park, MNP Venezuela) we observed that bleaching did not occur at the maximum SST of July-September, but a month later, similarly to the report made to the coral list by G. Díaz et al. for Santa Marta, Colombia (fecha). In this case, however, we have not identified a mechanism such as upwelling, that helps to explain this delay between maximum temperature and bleaching. <br>

Between the 23rd of September and the 4th of October of 2005, during the annual surveys of the GCRMN and CARICOMP, we examined five reefs, two oceanics, at Los Roques Archipelago National Park and three continental reefs at MNP. We surveyed more than 500 colonies between 5 and 12 m depth, and only two colonies were partially bleached (< 5% of their surface).  Sea surface temperature (SST) was
30 °C. <br>
By the end of October, SST was also 30 °C but we found that 21 ± 4% of the colonies (n = 5 transects) had bleached in Cayo Sombrero (CS) at MNP. Most affected species were: <br>
M. franksi (50%)<br>
M. faveolata (31%)<br>
C. natans (15%)<br>
M. meandrites (100%)<br>
A. agaricites (67%) <br>
hydrocorals Millepora spp (38%).<br>
Of the bleached colonies, 19% were afected in < 10% of their surface, 5% were afected in 10-25% of their surface, 19% in 25-50% of their surface and 60% of the colonies were bleached in 75-100% of their surface. We also observed bleached.colonies of  D. strigosa, M. cavernosa, P. astreoides, C. natans, D. laberyntiformis outside those transects.<br>

By the 13th of November, the SST had dropped to 28.7 °C but qualitatively we observed more colonies bleached than the previous two weeks and it seemed more intense in terms of colony whiteness.  Thus, in Cayo Sombrero bleaching did not occur at the maximum SST in july-september, but a month later. <br>

We will keep monitoring this event and hope to report the recovery of the colonies in the next weeks.<br>","Sebastian Rodriguez [sebastianr@usb.ve] in Coral list 11/24/2005","VEN","LOW"

haphazardly laid at several inshore patch reef sites in Biscayne National
Park.  Three transects in the vicinity of Marker 9, two near Marker 13, and
three in the area of Bache Shoals were conducted.  Coral colonies that were
under the line were recorded and their condition was evaluated. Condition
categories were: okay, slightly pale (lightened), pale (very lightened),
partial bleaching (patches of total bleaching), and bleached (100% w/o
zooxanthellae color). <br>
Of the colonies measured [89 colonies, 10 species (incl. Palythoa
caribaeorum)] 11% were normal and 89% exhibited some bleaching (30% were
totally bleached and 58% had paling or patchy bleaching).<br>
In the transects, species affected were Agaricia agaracites, Diploria
clivosa, Diploria strigosa, Montastrea annularis, Porites asteroides,
Porites porites, Sidereastrea siderea, Stephanocoenia mechellini and
Palythoa sp. Species unaffected were Dichocoenia stokesii.<br>
Outside the transect, species affected were Acropora cervicornis (A. palmata
was not seen at the reefs) and Montastrea cavernosa, Millepora complanata,
M. alcicornis, Erythropodium caribaeorum (encrusting gorgonian) and Briaream
asbestinum. Species that were unaffected included Eusmilia fastigiata.

A majority of the Acropora palmata colonies were either bleached or partially bleached.  Species from the genera Diploria, Porites, Siderastrea, and Millepora were also affected. We also noticed several bleached mats of Palythoa spp.. Most of the corals still appeared to be alive but there were a couple with signs of new algae growth.","David R.

2005,"Virgin Islands (U.S.)","Buck Island, St. Croix",17.787,-64.628,"During October 16-30, 2005, bleaching was observed in 53% of corals at 91 of 94 randomly selected sites raging in depth between 9 and 91 ft  (2.7 and 27.5 m). Twelve coral species had bleaching greater than 50%, with four species being more than 90% bleached (Diploria labrynthiformis, Agaricia spp., Mycetophyllia spp., and Montastraea annularis). <br>
Several abundant corals also were severely bleached; four corals (M. annularis, D. strigosa, Porites astreoides, and Agaracia spp.) had cover greater than 9,850 cm 2 and experienced bleaching from 40  95%. Fire corals (Millepora spp.) comprised 11,400 cm 2 of total cover and were bleached 60%. Acropora palmata covered 21,800 cm 2 of the sampled area but was less severely bleached (23%). <br>
Some corals had bleaching less than 20% (Stephanocoenia. interceptis, Madracis spp., Dichocoenia stokesii, Meandrina meandrites), and other corals had no bleaching (Acropora cervicornis; Diploria cylindricus, Eusmilia spp., and Scolymia spp., <br>
In general, the coral bleaching event was widespread and occurred all around Buck Island but with no obvious spatial patterns. Also, no spatial patterns were observed in the occurrence of bleaching for four abundant coral species. A weak but significant correlation (r 2 = 0.159, P = 0.0023) occurred between overall bleaching and depth, such that corals at shallower sites had higher rates of bleaching than those at deeper sites. If coral bleaching is temperature related, the observed correlation between depth and bleaching suggests that water temperature at depth would be lower than at the surface. However, water temperature, measured with a dive computer (Oceanic ProPlus 2) was not significantly lower at deeper sites than at shallower sites (r 2 = 0.004, P = 0.633, F = 0.230, df = 60). Overall, the water temperature ranged from 82 to 95 oF with a mean = 88.9 ± 0.19 oF (from 27.7 to 35 oC, mean = 31.6 ± 0.1 oC).<br>

Report on 11/5/2005 <br>
During monitoring in response to the bleaching event within the US Virgin
Islands, we've noticed a dramatic increase in the coloration (trend to
normal color) of corals within our study reefs around St. John.  This has
happened within the past 10 - 14 days.  Most corals have at least some
light color (as opposed to white), and some have gradients from pale to
full normal color.  No single species seems to be changing color more
rapidly than any other. Depths of our monitoring sites are between 15-60
ft (4.6-8.3 m).<br>

The mean seawater temperature (55 ft/16.8 m) at a monitoring site at
Tektite Reef went from 30.4º C (86.7º F) in September to 29.6º C (85.3º F)
in October.<br>

October was a very rainy and cloudy month.  During the period 9/30 -
10/11, 11.04 inches (28 cm) of rain were recorded while the seawater
temperature at a monitoring site (depth 55 ft/16.8 m) dropped 1.6 ºC (~3

But it recovered year by year, at this year, the live hard coral percentage come back to 70%. This recovery of hard coral percentage means hard coral in this area grow up well and the environment for hard coral keeps good. And other reason, main stream of the Kuroshio current, major warm current in western Pacific ocean, stays near shore of Kii peninsula in a last few years, so the seawater temperature in winter keeps not so cold. This 70% of live hard coral percentage is very good to compare to Okinawa area, the hard coral in Okinawa got major damage in a few years. We found many Drupella spp. in last survey, but this year, we cound not found them at the transect and near it, so we think an influence of these shell is not so high now. However, we have to note shell damage in the future. 
We found many tropical fishes like a kind of Pomacentridae species, they are not original indicator in RC but we choose some of them for additional indicator, we think one of the reason is the warm current stay near the shore. We found no major change in invertebrate survey.""

The live hard coral coverage by visual census is about 70 - 80 %, this is better than last survey. By the substrate survey, the percent of HC is changed from 61.3 % last year to 76.9 % this year. We found many young Acropora, which diameter is about 5 cm. We count only a few butterfly fish and parrot fish, and count only one giant shell, but it isn't big change from last survey. We found no COTS and no coral disease.

The northern reef slope of Kohama island, where is this survey area, is one of the most healthy and beautiful sight place in Sekisei lagoon. There was no damage by typhoon, no bleaching in summer and no eaten by Crown of Thorns Starfish in a few years, so tabler type Acropora grow very well at the reef slope. For the last a few years, the live coral coverage in Sekisei lagoon became bad because there got many damage by COTS or other reason, so this area, where keeps good condition, is very important area for supply source of offspring. We want to set protected area in there because the COTS damage is expanding now, but it is hard to conservation in winter because it is bad condition in winter season by stron northern wind in this northern reef.

Montipora foliosa - Edges of whorls bleached<br>
In this location there are many table corals (Acropora cytherea) that have come up after the 1998 coral bleaching event, which destroyed almost all corals in these shallow coral patches. No signs of bleaching were observed on Acropora cytherea. 2 small colonies of Acropora muricata about 25 cm high were completely bleached. Bleached massive coral colonies were relatively small (about 30 cm across or less). Partial bleaching was observed on massive corals. <br>
In the latter half of March 2005 the temperature on land was relatively high with humidity 90% or higher. The sea surface temperature was not measured where the bleaching was observed. <br>
Since 31st of March 2005 the weather on the west coast has changed to pre-monsoon. This means that there is SW winds and rain. If the rainy weather continues it might save the corals from further bleaching.

2010,"Cambodia","Koh Rong and Koh Rong Samloem",10,103,"Like  many  others diving in the Gulf of Thailand, we have been seeing
significant coral bleaching around the Cambodian islands of Koh Rong and Koh Rong Samloem. The extent of this bleaching has been severe with many reef sites showing bleaching levels of 90 to 100% across all coral species. These sites were all shallow-water reefs no deeper than 12 meters. The bleaching began in mid-April and reached its peak about 3-4 weeks ago when the water temperatures increased by at least 2??C, bringing surface water temperatures up to 34??C and over. The  start  of  the  rainy  season  last week has brought cooler water temperatures but has also resulted in heavy sedimentation levels, smothering and  killing  off  many of the bleached colonies. Acropora spp. And D. Heliopora colonies have been hit particularly hard but there are some large Porites colonies which seem to be coping with the unusual conditions. With water temperatures dropping back to 31??C, we are hoping to see some colour returning to Cambodia???s reefs! If you would like further information and images of the bleaching event, feel  free to get in touch with me directly or contact Vicki Bush, the Project Scientist in Cambodia at [1]cambodia at coralcay.org.

1998,"Philippines","Hilarys Reef and Convention Reef, Danjugan Island, Negros Occidental",9.87,122.37,"Bleaching occurred over  August and September 1998. Corals were affected to a depth of 18m. Percentage of bleached corals was seen to range from 35 to 90% between 0 and 25m depth around the whole island. The reduction in percent corals bleached at all depths over the first year of observation was dramatic (live coral cover fell from a maximum of 80% for all depths to between 0 and 10% in 1999). Around Danjugan, these areas were dominated by colonies of branching Acropora spp. and Seriatopora hystrix. 
Initially, an average of around 80% of corals from all depths were bleached at Hilarys Reef. Corals that bleached were dominated by P. clavus in the shallow depths of Hilarys Reef. In deeper depths, more delicate plating forms such as were seen to bleach, but not as severely as the P. clavus from the 6m quadrats.Bleaching over the shallower areas was also recorded in soft coral forms (Sinularia flexibilis, other Sinularia spp. and Sarcophyton spp.). Within the first year from September 1998 to August 1999, there was little or no recovery of soft corals.<a href=""http://www.reefbase.org/threats/images/danjungan_bl_1998.pdf"" target=""_blank""> Bleaching pictures </a>","Beger, M., J-L.Solandt and T.

2002,"Torres Strait & Great Barrier Reef","Heron Island",-23.4439,151.9286,"Acropora colonies (staghorn corals) are mainly affected although there is a general whitening of most species. 
The corals showing the next greatest effect are the bushy species such as Pocillopora, Stylophora and Seriatopora.(Hoegh-Guldberg, O. et al.)

Coral bleaching was observed with about 7% of corals bleached. 
Observed maximum water temperture was 28.2 deg C.
Bleaching was most extensive at intermediate depths of the upper 
slope, at 3-6m, compared to shallower upper slope and reef flat. 
Acropora cervicorn was most severely affected, followed by 
A. nobilis, A. formosa, A. yongei, A. abrolhosensis.
Partial bleaching of corals was observed in the intertidal lagoon. 
A. palifera, A. millepora, and several montiporiids were affected.
Bleaching of other corals was rare. 
Extensive turbidity was observed during the bleaching event which 
was not observed at near-by One tree Island where bleaching was 
minimal.  Algal blooms were extensive in patches of staghorn acroporids 0.5-2m depth at upper slope. These were severely bleached in 1998. 
Bleaching was in 'recovery' phase, i.e. Bleached colonies were 
recovering their color, measured photosynthetic yeilds were 
reduced compared to unbleached corals, but were not as low as in 
bleached corals (Fv/Fm 0.4-0.65). (A. Salih, 26/2/2002).

The amount of bleaching has increased during the past few weeks 
- perhaps due to the ""maturing"" of previous damage and/or added 
insult from low tides in the middle of the day.  The final analysis 
indicates something like 60-70% of corals in the intertidal being
completely bleached with mortality running at around 20%.  Off the 
reef crest - most sites are bleached to about 20-30% down to 10 m.  
Bleaching is noticeably greater closer to Gladstone (seen from the 
air as your fly by Heli to Gladstone) (Hoegh-Guldberg, 20/3/2002)","Hoegh-Guldberg, O., R. Johnstone and  S. Dove

2005,"American Samoa","Nuuuli pool, Tutuila",-14.28,-170.715,"Staghorn corals (Acropora formosa = A. muricata) have begun bleaching in the fringing reef pools of Tutuila, American Samoa.  As of 10/29/05, over 95% of A. formosa in Nuuuli pool, Tutuila, American Samoa are partly bleached.  Mike King reports similar bleaching in Alofau pool, Tutuila.  They recovered from the previous summer's bleaching just 5 months ago.<br>
Some have suggested that due to rising temperatures from global warming, in the future coral reefs may bleach every summer.  This is already happening in the pools of American Samoa.  Because it is a regular, annual event, and there are several possible controls, this offers an opportunity for scientists to plan studies of bleaching instead of having to take advantage of unpredictable opportunities.<br>
For the past two Austral summers, I have recorded the bleaching of three species of staghorn Acropora  (A. formosa, A. pulchra, and A. nobilis) in the fringing reef pools of Tutuila, American Samoa.  Acopora formosa and Porites cylindrica dominate the pools of Tutuila, but P. cylindrica was not observed to bleach.  Bleaching of the three staghorns has reached as high as 100 percent of the colonies in some of the pools, with colonies nearly entirely white.  At the same time, very few corals on the outer reef slopes were observed bleaching.  Acropora nobilis is present on the outer slopes (though not common), and did not bleach there when the same species strongly bleached in the pools.  The pools reach higher temperatures than on the outer slopes.  Most of the pools had peak temperatures of 32-33 oC in the last summer, but one hit a peak of 34.9 oC (for a half hour).  The highest temperatures occur on sunny summer days when low tide is midday, reducing circulation.  High temperatures are well known in the pools of nearby Ofu island, American Samoa (Craig, Birkeland, and Belliveau, 2001).  Those pools have a higher diversity of corals and less bleaching.<br>
Mass coral bleaching on outer reef slopes was observed by several people in American Samoa in 2002 and 2003, though the time and intensity were not recorded.  At present, about half of all staghorn colonies in the pools are dead.  Essentially none have died in the past two years, so it is likely they died in 2002 and/or 2003, when bleaching was more intense.  Thus, along with the present bleaching, staghorns in the pools have bleached for five years in a row. <br>    
In 2004, staghorns in the pools began to bleach in March, peaked in April, and ended in August.  Bleaching started again in November (04), peaked in the January to April (05) period, and ended at the end of May (05).  Now bleaching has started again at the end of October (05).  Pool staghorns are spending more of the year bleached than recovered, year after year.","Douglas Fenner, Dept. of Marine & Wildlife Resources, American Samoa (Douglas Fenner [dfenner@blueskynet.as] in Coral list 11/8/2005","ASM","LOW"

2004,"American Samoa","Tutuila Lagoons",-14.284,-170.674,"A mild coral bleaching event is currently underway in American Samoa.  About 1/4 to 3/4 of living staghorns are at least partially bleached in 3 lagoons on Tutuila.  Only upper surfaces of horizontal branches have any bleaching (usually it is only partial even on upper surfaces); undersides always retain some color.  No colonies are totally bleached, none recently dead.  A few A. palifera and A. cf. listeri are bleached, but there are very few colonies of these species in the lagoons.  Other species are not bleached.  Bleaching was first seen on March 20.  The last previous check of these corals was on Feb 28.
     Temperature loggers in one lagoon show temperatures rising to a peak averaging a little over 30C in mid-February, and remaining fairly steady since then.  Peak temperatures reach 32C for a few hours on some days.  These 3 lagoons have little water circulating into them at low tide.  25-75% of staghorns in the more closed lagoons are bleached.  Similar areas with the same staghorns that have open circulation with the ocean have very little bleaching (about 1-5%).  Reef fronts that have been looked at also have no bleaching, but do not have these staghorns.
    I am told that last year there was strong bleaching of the staghorns, and there was bleaching in the previous summer as well.

Records from temperature loggers show that the sea surface temperature in American Samoa was heating up in December and early January.  When Hurricane Heta hit on Jan 6, 2004 it caused a sudden large drop in sea surface temperatures, most likely due to wave mixing of surface waters with cooler deeper water.  After Jan 6, sea surface temperature began to warm again, starting at a new lower base.  So in effect, Hurricane Heta reset the summer warming of surface waters.  Presumably then the maximum temperatures that were reached were lower than they would have been otherwise, and bleaching was more mild than it would have been otherwise.  Normal summer bleaching here may be closer to that experienced in the previous two summers, when mass bleaching of perhaps 20-30% of corals on reef slopes was followed by the death of some table corals on slopes and some staghorns and fire coral in lagoons.","Doug Fenner [dfenner@blueskynet.as] in Coral-list@coral.aoml.noaa.gov 30/3/2004 and personal communication to ReefBase.","ASM","LOW"

As water temperatures were not yet very high (28oC) this may be due to sedimentation.

This led to some bleaching at a national scale, principally of the genus Acropora corals, but only in shallow waters. Shallow areas (2-4m) in which the CCC Fiji data is derived showed 5 % of coral colonies of the genus Acropora having been bleached. There was also one large area of Acropora coral at 14 m near Sunflower reef where a 15 m2 area was bleached, but only the apical portions of the colonys branches. Other than this small percent of bleached coral and the deeper bleaching at Sunflower, there appeared to be little overall impact of the bleaching in the Mamanucas for April-May 2002. Bleaching in 2002 was not nearly as significant as the bleaching event that occurred in 2000.","Walker, D., J.L. Solandt, S. Haycock, J. Taylor, S. Harding and P. Raines, 2002

By 21 Aug 1996 mean SST in Kaneohe Bay reached 28.5 C and was increasing rapidly. Wind speed dropped to a low level.  Solar radiation input was at near annual maximum with little cloud cover. Corals throughout the inner portion of Kaneohe Bay began to show signs of stress including contracted polyps, mucous secretion and some discoloration. Maximum mid-day temperature on the reef began to exceed 30 C starting on 26 Aug
1996. By 31 August 1996 the daily mean SST exceeded 30 C with a daily mid day maximum approaching 30.7 C.  By this time the bleaching process was conspicuously underway in corals throughout the inner portion of the bay.  Corals in the lagoon area directly in front of the main building of the Hawaii Institute of Marine Biology experienced higher temperatures due to restricted circulation and were highly bleached by 26 August 1996. Large tracts of corals throughout the inshore portion of Kaneohe Bay became highly bleached by 4 September. The areas where significant amounts of bleaching occurred were confined to the inner portion of Kaneohe Bay. The proportion of coral heads that bleached throughout the affected area varied from less than 5% in some areas to 100% over large sections of reef.  The amount of bleaching diminished near stream discharge points or other areas where turbidity was high.  Bleaching decreased with depth, especially in localized areas of high turbidity.  
The period of highest thermal stress occurred between 14 August and 5 September (22 days).  During this time period the mean daily temperature remained in the 29-30 C  range.  The corals became progressively more bleached throughout September even  though temperature was declining.  Maximum bleaching occurred from 2 to 4 weeks  after the peak of highest temperature.  A second less severe warming episode  developed in early October, but peak temperature remained below 29 C and did  not appear to further increase the rate of bleaching.  By mid October  temperatures diminished into the normal range and recovery of bleached  corals was underway.  Corals that were only slightly bleached started to regain pigmentation.  The remaining zooxanthellae in the lower shaded portions of bleached colonies began to rapidly re-infect the upper surface bleached areas.  Corals that were highly bleached died or regained pigment very slowly.
Most of the colonies throughout the bay had recovered by mid November.  Some of the highly bleached colonies  still were white in color in late November, but regained full pigment by the end of December 1996.","Jokiel, P.L. personal communication to  NOAA & ReefBase (18/7/2003)","USA","HIGH"

Jean Kenyon and Greta Aeby confirmed substantial coral bleaching at several reef systems in the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands during surveys conducted in September/October 2004. At Pearl & Hermes Atoll and Midway Atoll, bleaching was most pronounced in the shallow backreef habitat, with Montipora capitata and Pocillopora meandrina most frequently affected. The incidence of bleaching in the shallow backreef habitat at Kure, the northernmost atoll in the Hawaiian Archipelago, was less than that at Pearl & Hermes and at Midway, with the same taxa most frequently affected.","Jean Kenyon, Ph.D. [""Jean.Kenyon,.Ph.D.""@noaa.gov] in coral list 24/10/2004","USA","UNKNOWN"
