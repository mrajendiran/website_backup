2010,"Trinidad and Tobago","Tobago reef",11,-60,"As a follow up to my pervious post on ""Coral bleaching and an unknown sponge disease in Tobago"", I returned to a monitoring site, surveyed only 10 dys earlier, and I to my dismay, within the 20-40ft depth area there is mass mortality of the Giant Barrel Sponges (Xestospongia muta).  Some of the other songes are also looking a bit poorly, but not to the extent of mortality.  Samples have been retrieved for analysis both heathy and unhealthy looking X. muta.  That said, even heathy looking sponges were snapping off at their bases.  There is also wide spread bleaching, especially at the 23-35ft depth at Speyside, affecting most species(Montastrea faviolata, Siderastrea sidera, S. radians, all Diplorias, M.
Anularis, Millipora, octocorals etc). Speyside's reefs are generally sponge
dominated, but the main reef building coral species are Montastrea
faveolata, Siderastrea sidera, Diploria spp. And Madracis mirabilis.  At
deeper depths, up to 60ft moderate bleaching was observed, and only of
particular species (Meandrina meandrities and Siderastrea sidera).  The
water temperature at this depth was quite warm, with temperature loggers
recording on the reefs at 30ft showing temperatures up to 31 deg C.
 Interestingly some resiliency studies/models indicate that the longer lived
and slower growing species, such as boulder corals (Montastreas and
Siderastrea) are more resilient that branching species (Porities and
Madracis), however very very little bleaching of M. mirabilis was observed.
 M. mirabilis can be found in extensive spreads in Speyside with octocorals,
sponges, boulder and brain corals inter-dispersed.

Thus far the north eastern side of the island is the only location I've been
able to follow up on, but I have received reports of increased bleaching
along the Caribbean coast and south west of the island.

2010,"Bahamas","San Salvador",24.1,-74.483333," Earthwatch Institute research-team conducted seasonal monitoring on shallow-water patch reefs on San Salvador Island, Bahamas. Results of the monitoring determined the majority Agaricia agaricites colonies were showing signs of bleaching - with many colonies exhibiting bleaching of greater than 75 percent. Also, as part of a reef restoration experiment, many Acropora palmata transplants suffered mortality since the project's last monitoring effort in July.  Prior to July, most of the transplants had survived over one year and had exhibited new tissue growth. Review of temperature logger data showed water temperatures >30C  in August. Finally, and somewhat curiously, much less algae was observed on the reefs than in previous monitoring efforts and large corals (e.g., Diploria sp., Montastrea sp., etc.) exhibited little, if any, ill effects.

Anecdotal reports from residents on the island indicated that air temperatures in August were the hottest that anyone could remember.
Also, for the last two months there have been excessive winds with the elevations of both high and low tides being far greater (and sustained) than anyone could ever remember","[Coral List ] : Rollino, John.  (Principal Investigator, Bahamian Reef Survey, Earthwatch

2010,"Cambodia","Koh Rong and Koh Rong Samloem",10,103,"Like  many  others diving in the Gulf of Thailand, we have been seeing
significant coral bleaching around the Cambodian islands of Koh Rong and Koh Rong Samloem. The extent of this bleaching has been severe with many reef sites showing bleaching levels of 90 to 100% across all coral species. These sites were all shallow-water reefs no deeper than 12 meters. The bleaching began in mid-April and reached its peak about 3-4 weeks ago when the water temperatures increased by at least 2??C, bringing surface water temperatures up to 34??C and over. The  start  of  the  rainy  season  last week has brought cooler water temperatures but has also resulted in heavy sedimentation levels, smothering and  killing  off  many of the bleached colonies. Acropora spp. And D. Heliopora colonies have been hit particularly hard but there are some large Porites colonies which seem to be coping with the unusual conditions. With water temperatures dropping back to 31??C, we are hoping to see some colour returning to Cambodia???s reefs! If you would like further information and images of the bleaching event, feel  free to get in touch with me directly or contact Vicki Bush, the Project Scientist in Cambodia at [1]cambodia at coralcay.org.  We will also be presenting our monitoring results at the 2^nd Asia-Pacific Coral Reef Symposium in Phuket later this month.","[Coral list] From: jvb at coralcay.org (Jan-Willem van Bochove)","KHM","HIGH"

Some Poscillopora seemed to have died from bleaching (still white).  Most hard coral was live. Most dead coral was long dead.

The area was dominated by seagrass with isolated coral colonies/groups of colonies and some coral outcrops dominated by hard coral cover.
