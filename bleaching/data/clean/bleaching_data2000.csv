My observations come from Kijembe Reef (a lagoonal patch reef), just north of the coastal town of Mombasa. NOAA satellite monitoring currently shows the accumulated thermal stress in the
waters around Kenya and Tanzania to be 3 DHW.
<br>
Pocillopora is the main group to be affected (P. eydouxi, P. verrucosa and
P. damicornis) with normal, pale and fully bleached colonies observed. Other
genera showing pale tissue include Porites, Platygyra, Echinopora, Galaxea,
Goniopora, Astreopora, Montipora and Hydnophora (one individual only).
Acropora species at the site are all normal, and have only been affected by
crown-of-thorns starfish which are present in elevated numbers at the site.
<br>No colonies appeared to have died from bleaching to date.

2003,"Kenya","Kiunga",-1.986,41.383,"Paling of coral colonies was first observed in Kiunga during monitoring prior to March 24, however it was so mild that it was not specially noted.  From April 4 in Kiunga, bleaching was first observed and reported widely.  Following that, pale, partially bleached and some fully bleached corals were reported widely throughout Kenya. 
Bleaching is mild to moderate rather than severe; colonies are paling, and all shades of colour from normal to white are observed. In Kenya, most paling and bleaching is on upper surfaces, and the coincidence of high temperatures, calm conditions and spring low tides just prior to bleaching suggest combined effects of these factors rather than an overwhelming dominance of one.
The spatial extent of paling and bleaching amounts to perhaps 10-20% of coral cover and 5-25% or colonies, with most observations made in shallow inner-reef zones (water depth of 0.3-1m at MLW).  
Most detail on taxonomic incidence of bleaching has come from reports in Kenya, where the most affected genus is Pocillopora, where locally close to 100% of colonies have been observed bleached, and some colonies observed with dead patches (primarily around the branch tips). Interestingly, P. damicornis is less affected than other species, and in one shallow reef flat area is unaffected. After Pocillopora, the most strongly affected genera include Porites, Echinopora, Galaxea and partially affected genera include Platygyra, Acropora, Montipora, various faviids and fungiids, Pavona.","David Obura

From repeated surveys in the Mombasa area in April/May, it appears that the incidence of bleaching is not increasing, and it remains to be seen to what extent colonies recover or die.  From temperature logger data for Mombasa, the bleaching was only observed at the end of the temperature plateau around April 10, and since then water temperatures have steadily declined.","David Obura

This zone is constantly exposed to increases of temperature influenced by the diurnal contributions from the Juluapan Lagoon, from which influxes of water at 27,5 and 32.0 °C in winter and summer, respectively.
During the summer of 2004 (AprilJune) diving campaigns were undertaken to study the bleaching phenomenon in this zone.  Bleaching evaluations of Pocillopora capitata were conducted by assessing  the concentrations of chlorophyll a and total carotenoids from samples along submarine transect lines.
The coralline population at La Boquita is under a state of local thermal stress, which is a direct consequence of the inappropriate location of the artificial intercommunication structure of the Juluapan Lagoon, which could cause irreversible damage to the reef's productivity, adaptability and regeneration capacity.","Ms Angelica Flores Ramirez,  Universidad de Colima.","MEX","NONE"

2009,"Mexico (Caribbean)","Akumal reef",20.415154,-87.29962,"An intense bleaching event is also occurring along the Mexican Caribbean Coast. Our first observations of pale corals was done in May in Akumal reef, with 7% of the colonies showing pale coloration at a depth of 10-15m. By June, 9% of the colonies were bleached-pale in Mahahual Reef at the same depth. By July, 32% of the colonies were bleached-pale in Punta Allen reef.

At present, (August-September) surveys at Puerto Morelos reef show that 41% of the colonies were bleached and 31% of them were completely white.
Surveys were done at a depth of 4-8m.

The number of colonies sampled at each site was over 2000. Almost all scleractinian species showed bleaching signs, as well as some gorgonians, Milleporas and zoanthids.","MC. Rosa Rodríguez-Martínez

2005,"Bahamas","San Salvador",23.9994,-74.5575,"During the week of November 20th, 2005, an Earthwatch Institute Research Team ""The Bahamian Reef Survey"" discovered a bleaching event in progress on patch reefs around San Salvador, Bahamas. The bleaching was evident primarily on Agaricia sp., Favia fragum, and Porites sp. (finger corals) - although Porites asteroids, had limited bleaching. Limited bleaching of Montastrea annularis was also observed; however, many coral heads of this species displayed significant blanching. Water quality testing showed physical and chemical parameters were within normal levels at the time.

The Bahamian Reef Survey has collected data since 1992, on the shallow patch reefs surrounding the Island. This bleaching event is the third bleaching event documented on San Salvador in that time period. Initially the data suggest that the bleaching event is similar to a 1995/96 bleaching event in both scope and affected species. While no proximal cause was found for the earlier event, it appears that higher than normal sea temperatures have been involved in precipitating this event.","John Rollino [John.Rollino@earthtech.com] in Coral list 12/1/2005","BHS","UNKNOWN"

Water temps. Have been above 29 Celcius since June (Hobo data). I will be conducting disease surveys in mid-November, so if anything like what we saw in 2005 with WPD and YBD outbreaks during and after the massive bleaching occurs here, we will probably have a chance to document this in our permanent survey transects around the island. Croy will be conducting quantitative surveys and tagging colonies in the next days. 

On the other hand, here in Puerto Rico, there are no signs of a bleaching event. Just the usual, a few pale colonies here and there. Same situation observed during our disease surveys last week in Grenada.","Observer: Croy McCoy

In the area, lobster fishing with compressors is supposedly illegal but this is not enforced. Most of the fishermen use air compressors to dive on the reefs. This is a popular site for lobster fishing and spear gun fishing on the reefs. Fishermen drop anchors on reef - could benefit from buoys.","Reef Check submitted by Darien Clary.

The area has been sampled using REEFCHECK to contain between 16% and 21% live coral. <br>
Bleaching observed within shallow lagoon areas (<3M depth) behind reef and areas likely influenced by warm lagoon waters.<br>
This bleaching event is not as yet particularly intensive. It will be observed for change in the coming weeks.<br>
Water temperature was measured by Citizen wrist-mounted digital thermometer to be 31 degrees Celsius.<br>
Level and prominence of bleaching observed as follows:<br>
Millepora spp. (mainly complanata): Bleaching occurring in less then 50% of colonies. Bleaching intensity strong in less then 25% of cases.<br>
Montastrea annularis: Bleaching occurring in less then 20% of colonies. No colonies larger then 30cm diameter affected. Bleaching rarely (<10 of cases) more intense then simple fading of colour from uppermost area.<br>
Acropora cervicornis: Bleaching occurring on 70% of colonies observed; patchy, and mainly on upper surfaces of branch. Larger colonies (30CM diameter) more likely to be affected then small colonies and single branches. Bleaching accompanied by white band disease in four colonies. (A. cervicornis is relatively rare. <20 colonies observed total). <br>
Agaricia agaricites: Bleaching observed on colony ridges, patchy. Less then 20 individuals observed displaying notable bleaching in this locally common species.  <br>
Porites porites: Bleaching observed as fading of colour on upper faces of branches and growth tips in four colonies, all of the brown morph. This species and morph is common.<br>
Palythoa caribaeorum: one colony observed to be partially bleached, colours faded on its upper surface. This species is uncommon in this area. (< 10 colonies observed)<br>

2005,"Colombia","Islas del Rosario (National Natural Park)",10.167,-75.767,"A massive bleaching of corals is taking place since aprox 10-15 days (since late June) at Islas del Rosario (National Natural Park) near the city of Cartagena, Colombia. I was there on holidays during the weekend of 8-10 July and took many photos in shallow waters (down to 5 m) around the Oceanarium at San Martín de Pajarales Island (10°10'37.7""N-75°46'16.2""). Resident people had been noticing the bleaching since about 1-2 weeks before my arrival, associated with extremely warm, and possibly quite brackish waters (from nearby river discharges).<br>
Almost all corals were totally white to pale yellow. Some massive star coral colonies (Montastraea annularis and M. faveolata) still had slightly colored basal patches. Brain coral species (Diploria and Colpophyllia) were completely bleached. Porites porites beds were totally white. P. astreoides knobs were from white to light lemon yellow. Siderastrea siderea was less affected with a dark bluish-violet color in several colonies, and a few normally brown. S. radians was apparently not affected (hard to tell, the small encrustations of this species being normally so light). Even Favia fragum golfball corals were fully bleached. Benthic, rubble-dwelling anemones (probably corallymorpharians) were white. Millepora spp. had both white, normal and ""pinto"" (patchy) like colonies-branches. Did not see any Acropora to tell whether the few remaining colonies bleached or not.<br>

It seemed that deeper corals were less bleached. However, Jaime Rojas, biologist working for both the National Park authorities and the Oceanarium, undertook on July 8 a quick survey around the islands confirming that the phenomenon is widespread. He is making a follow up, and working with daily sea-surface temperature data (possibly salinity too) taken regularly at the Oceanarium. Later on he may make a more detailed report. <br> 
No sponges had bleached. Even brown encrusting Cliona, which harbor zooxanthellae, were fine. <br>

Valentino Duffis, a Fisher Advisor to CORALINA said, ""in his 25 years of fishing the San Andres Archipelago, he had never witnessed the calm weather conditions for as long as he has over the past few months.""  His observation was that thermal stress was having an impact on  the marine environment. <br>

2005,"Colombia","Tayrona Natural National Park,  off the city of Santa Marta",11.333,-74.133,"Pale colonies of Montastraea annularis were first observed in
shallow waters (<10m) at Bahía de Nenguange on the 21st of October. A week later, most M. annularis colonies were bleached, showing the classic
bleaching pattern being more intense on top than on the sides, while
Colpophyllia natans colonies were pale. By the 11th of November the
bleaching event became more evident: nearly all colonies of M. annularis
and Porites porites were severely bleached, while most M. faveolata,
Diploria labyrinthiformis, Colpophyllia natans, Porites astreoides,
Siderastrea siderea, Millepora spp., and the zoanthid Palythoa
caribbaeorum were partially bleached. Similar observations were made in
coral reefs of Bahía de Taganga, adjacent to the TNNP, however, most P.
astreoides colonies were severely bleached in Taganga, in contrast to
Bahia de Neguange. <br>

It is interesting to note that corals at the TNNP bleached quite late
compared to other reef corals throughout the Caribbean [e.g. reefs at
Islas del Rosario, only 200 k southwest from the TNNP, bleached 4 months
earlier in late June (report by Sven Zea posted in coral list)]. This
might have some relation to the bi-modal seasonal upwelling that occurs in
the area, with upwelling peaks taking place early in the year and by
July-August. <br>

2005,"Venezuela","Cayo Sombrero (Morrocoy National Park, MNP Venezuela)",10.887,-68.221,"In Cayo Sombrero (Morrocoy National Park, MNP Venezuela) we observed that bleaching did not occur at the maximum SST of July-September, but a month later, similarly to the report made to the coral list by G. Díaz et al. for Santa Marta, Colombia (fecha). In this case, however, we have not identified a mechanism such as upwelling, that helps to explain this delay between maximum temperature and bleaching. <br>

Between the 23rd of September and the 4th of October of 2005, during the annual surveys of the GCRMN and CARICOMP, we examined five reefs, two oceanics, at Los Roques Archipelago National Park and three continental reefs at MNP. We surveyed more than 500 colonies between 5 and 12 m depth, and only two colonies were partially bleached (< 5% of their surface).  Sea surface temperature (SST) was
30 °C. <br>
By the end of October, SST was also 30 °C but we found that 21 ± 4% of the colonies (n = 5 transects) had bleached in Cayo Sombrero (CS) at MNP. Most affected species were: <br>
M. franksi (50%)<br>
M. faveolata (31%)<br>
C. natans (15%)<br>
M. meandrites (100%)<br>
A. agaricites (67%) <br>
hydrocorals Millepora spp (38%).<br>
Of the bleached colonies, 19% were afected in < 10% of their surface, 5% were afected in 10-25% of their surface, 19% in 25-50% of their surface and 60% of the colonies were bleached in 75-100% of their surface. We also observed bleached.colonies of  D. strigosa, M. cavernosa, P. astreoides, C. natans, D. laberyntiformis outside those transects.<br>

By the 13th of November, the SST had dropped to 28.7 °C but qualitatively we observed more colonies bleached than the previous two weeks and it seemed more intense in terms of colony whiteness.  Thus, in Cayo Sombrero bleaching did not occur at the maximum SST in july-september, but a month later. <br>

We will keep monitoring this event and hope to report the recovery of the colonies in the next weeks.<br>","Sebastian Rodriguez [sebastianr@usb.ve] in Coral list 11/24/2005","VEN","LOW"

Cheeca Rocks is located offshore of the middle Florida Keys and this sites are currently being monitored as part of a dissertation study on coral disease. <br>
Five 16m2 permanent plots were established at each of these sites in August of 2004 and a total of 266 corals at Cheeca Rocks have been monitored for the incidence of bleaching and disease since that time.<br>
On August 11th, 2005, I observed some partial bleaching affecting only a few of the monitored colonies. When I returned on August 16th, paling and partial bleaching was occurring on 19% of the monitored corals at Cheeca Rocks.  This bleaching was mainly affecting species of Colpophyllia natans and Montastrea faveolata. However, at this point all of the monitored colonies of Agaricia agaricites within the quadrats were completely bleached. <br>
On September 1st, I revisited the sites to find that 74% of monitored corals at Cheeca Rocks were experiencing some extent of bleaching (paling, partial bleaching, or total colony bleaching).  The proportions of all colonies experiencing total bleaching (i.e. no observable color from zooxanthellae) were 11% at Cheeca Rocks.  <br>
Species most affected by the bleaching were C. natans, M. faveolata, and A. agaricites.  Other species found bleaching included M. annularis, M. cavernosa, Dichocoenia stokesii, Diploria clivosa, D. strigosa, D. labrynthiformis, Favia fragum, Meandrina meandrites, Mussa angulosa, Porites astreoides, P. porites, Siderastrea radians, S. siderea, and Stephanocoenia intersepta.  Species other than scleractinian corals observed to be bleaching included Millepora alcicornis, M. complanata, Palythoa caribaeorum, Erythropodium caribaeorum, Briareum asbestinum, and some other gorgonians. The only notable exception was individuals of Mycetophyllia spp. which appeared healthy and experienced no noticeable bleaching.<br>

Report on 11/5/2005 <br>
During monitoring in response to the bleaching event within the US Virgin
Islands, we've noticed a dramatic increase in the coloration (trend to
normal color) of corals within our study reefs around St. John.  This has
happened within the past 10 - 14 days.  Most corals have at least some
light color (as opposed to white), and some have gradients from pale to
full normal color.  No single species seems to be changing color more
rapidly than any other. Depths of our monitoring sites are between 15-60
ft (4.6-8.3 m).<br>

The mean seawater temperature (55 ft/16.8 m) at a monitoring site at
Tektite Reef went from 30.4º C (86.7º F) in September to 29.6º C (85.3º F)
in October.<br>

October was a very rainy and cloudy month.  During the period 9/30 -

But it recovered year by year, at this year, the live hard coral percentage come back to 70%. This recovery of hard coral percentage means hard coral in this area grow up well and the environment for hard coral keeps good. And other reason, main stream of the Kuroshio current, major warm current in western Pacific ocean, stays near shore of Kii peninsula in a last few years, so the seawater temperature in winter keeps not so cold. This 70% of live hard coral percentage is very good to compare to Okinawa area, the hard coral in Okinawa got major damage in a few years. We found many Drupella spp. in last survey, but this year, we cound not found them at the transect and near it, so we think an influence of these shell is not so high now. However, we have to note shell damage in the future. 
We found many tropical fishes like a kind of Pomacentridae species, they are not original indicator in RC but we choose some of them for additional indicator, we think one of the reason is the warm current stay near the shore. We found no major change in invertebrate survey.""

2005,"Sri Lanka","Bar Reef Marine Sanctuary",8.409,79.752,"Minor coral bleaching was observed on the 26th March 2005 among the reef crests of shallow coral banks of the Bar Reef Marine Sanctuary. The depth varied between 1 and 2m. Below is a table of the species affected and the degree to which they were bleached. It was noted that all the colonies of affected species were not bleached. <br>
Species affected and Level of bleaching<br>
Leptoria phrygia - Partial bleaching (mainly on upper surfaces of colonies)<br>
Favia pallida - Partial bleaching (mainly on upper surfaces of colonies)<br>
Favia favus - Partial bleaching (mainly on upper surfaces of colonies)<br>
Platygyra daedalea - Partial bleaching (mainly on upper surfaces of colonies)<br>
Hydnophora microconos - Partial bleaching (mainly on upper surfaces of colonies)<br>
Symphyllia radians - Partial bleaching<br> 
Pocillopora damicornis - Some branch tips only<br>
Acropora muricata (formally A. formosa) - 2 small colonies totally bleached<br>
Montipora foliosa - Edges of whorls bleached<br>
In this location there are many table corals (Acropora cytherea) that have come up after the 1998 coral bleaching event, which destroyed almost all corals in these shallow coral patches. No signs of bleaching were observed on Acropora cytherea. 2 small colonies of Acropora muricata about 25 cm high were completely bleached. Bleached massive coral colonies were relatively small (about 30 cm across or less). Partial bleaching was observed on massive corals. <br>
In the latter half of March 2005 the temperature on land was relatively high with humidity 90% or higher. The sea surface temperature was not measured where the bleaching was observed. <br>
Since 31st of March 2005 the weather on the west coast has changed to pre-monsoon. This means that there is SW winds and rain. If the rainy weather continues it might save the corals from further bleaching.
Minor coral bleaching was reported from SL last year too, from Trincomalee in the East coast and Rumassala reef in the south.","Rajasuriya, A. 2005.  	Coral Bleaching in the Bar Reef Marine Sanctuary Observed on 26th March 2005 Sri Lanka. CORDIO online document","LKA","LOW"

Sponge includes many branching tubular sponges which have increased, as well as massive sponges. Soft coral has decreased. Most COTs off-transect/belt were near segments 3 and 4, seems that segments 1 and 2 have been pretty much totallt predated causing a shift in the COTs population to areas with remaining HC cover. Many COTs outside transect also, including a group of 15 individuals around 1 massive coral about 30cm diameter. COTs attack main cause of coral death and subsequent breaking to rubble.

2002,"Torres Strait & Great Barrier Reef","Heron Island",-23.4439,151.9286,"Acropora colonies (staghorn corals) are mainly affected although there is a general whitening of most species. 
The corals showing the next greatest effect are the bushy species such as Pocillopora, Stylophora and Seriatopora.(Hoegh-Guldberg, O. et al.)

Coral bleaching was observed with about 7% of corals bleached. 
Observed maximum water temperture was 28.2 deg C.
Bleaching was most extensive at intermediate depths of the upper 
slope, at 3-6m, compared to shallower upper slope and reef flat. 
Acropora cervicorn was most severely affected, followed by 
A. nobilis, A. formosa, A. yongei, A. abrolhosensis.
Partial bleaching of corals was observed in the intertidal lagoon. 
A. palifera, A. millepora, and several montiporiids were affected.
Bleaching of other corals was rare. 
Extensive turbidity was observed during the bleaching event which 
was not observed at near-by One tree Island where bleaching was 
minimal.  Algal blooms were extensive in patches of staghorn acroporids 0.5-2m depth at upper slope. These were severely bleached in 1998. 
Bleaching was in 'recovery' phase, i.e. Bleached colonies were 
recovering their color, measured photosynthetic yeilds were 
reduced compared to unbleached corals, but were not as low as in 
bleached corals (Fv/Fm 0.4-0.65). (A. Salih, 26/2/2002).

The amount of bleaching has increased during the past few weeks 
- perhaps due to the ""maturing"" of previous damage and/or added 
insult from low tides in the middle of the day.  The final analysis 
indicates something like 60-70% of corals in the intertidal being
completely bleached with mortality running at around 20%.  Off the 
reef crest - most sites are bleached to about 20-30% down to 10 m.  
Bleaching is noticeably greater closer to Gladstone (seen from the 
air as your fly by Heli to Gladstone) (Hoegh-Guldberg, 20/3/2002)","Hoegh-Guldberg, O., R. Johnstone and  S. Dove

2005,"American Samoa","Nuuuli pool, Tutuila",-14.28,-170.715,"Staghorn corals (Acropora formosa = A. muricata) have begun bleaching in the fringing reef pools of Tutuila, American Samoa.  As of 10/29/05, over 95% of A. formosa in Nuuuli pool, Tutuila, American Samoa are partly bleached.  Mike King reports similar bleaching in Alofau pool, Tutuila.  They recovered from the previous summer's bleaching just 5 months ago.<br>
Some have suggested that due to rising temperatures from global warming, in the future coral reefs may bleach every summer.  This is already happening in the pools of American Samoa.  Because it is a regular, annual event, and there are several possible controls, this offers an opportunity for scientists to plan studies of bleaching instead of having to take advantage of unpredictable opportunities.<br>
For the past two Austral summers, I have recorded the bleaching of three species of staghorn Acropora  (A. formosa, A. pulchra, and A. nobilis) in the fringing reef pools of Tutuila, American Samoa.  Acopora formosa and Porites cylindrica dominate the pools of Tutuila, but P. cylindrica was not observed to bleach.  Bleaching of the three staghorns has reached as high as 100 percent of the colonies in some of the pools, with colonies nearly entirely white.  At the same time, very few corals on the outer reef slopes were observed bleaching.  Acropora nobilis is present on the outer slopes (though not common), and did not bleach there when the same species strongly bleached in the pools.  The pools reach higher temperatures than on the outer slopes.  Most of the pools had peak temperatures of 32-33 oC in the last summer, but one hit a peak of 34.9 oC (for a half hour).  The highest temperatures occur on sunny summer days when low tide is midday, reducing circulation.  High temperatures are well known in the pools of nearby Ofu island, American Samoa (Craig, Birkeland, and Belliveau, 2001).  Those pools have a higher diversity of corals and less bleaching.<br>
Mass coral bleaching on outer reef slopes was observed by several people in American Samoa in 2002 and 2003, though the time and intensity were not recorded.  At present, about half of all staghorn colonies in the pools are dead.  Essentially none have died in the past two years, so it is likely they died in 2002 and/or 2003, when bleaching was more intense.  Thus, along with the present bleaching, staghorns in the pools have bleached for five years in a row. <br>    
In 2004, staghorns in the pools began to bleach in March, peaked in April, and ended in August.  Bleaching started again in November (04), peaked in the January to April (05) period, and ended at the end of May (05).  Now bleaching has started again at the end of October (05).  Pool staghorns are spending more of the year bleached than recovered, year after year.","Douglas Fenner, Dept. of Marine & Wildlife Resources, American Samoa (Douglas Fenner [dfenner@blueskynet.as] in Coral list 11/8/2005","ASM","LOW"

2004,"American Samoa","Tutuila Lagoons",-14.284,-170.674,"A mild coral bleaching event is currently underway in American Samoa.  About 1/4 to 3/4 of living staghorns are at least partially bleached in 3 lagoons on Tutuila.  Only upper surfaces of horizontal branches have any bleaching (usually it is only partial even on upper surfaces); undersides always retain some color.  No colonies are totally bleached, none recently dead.  A few A. palifera and A. cf. listeri are bleached, but there are very few colonies of these species in the lagoons.  Other species are not bleached.  Bleaching was first seen on March 20.  The last previous check of these corals was on Feb 28.
     Temperature loggers in one lagoon show temperatures rising to a peak averaging a little over 30C in mid-February, and remaining fairly steady since then.  Peak temperatures reach 32C for a few hours on some days.  These 3 lagoons have little water circulating into them at low tide.  25-75% of staghorns in the more closed lagoons are bleached.  Similar areas with the same staghorns that have open circulation with the ocean have very little bleaching (about 1-5%).  Reef fronts that have been looked at also have no bleaching, but do not have these staghorns.
    I am told that last year there was strong bleaching of the staghorns, and there was bleaching in the previous summer as well.

Records from temperature loggers show that the sea surface temperature in American Samoa was heating up in December and early January.  When Hurricane Heta hit on Jan 6, 2004 it caused a sudden large drop in sea surface temperatures, most likely due to wave mixing of surface waters with cooler deeper water.  After Jan 6, sea surface temperature began to warm again, starting at a new lower base.  So in effect, Hurricane Heta reset the summer warming of surface waters.  Presumably then the maximum temperatures that were reached were lower than they would have been otherwise, and bleaching was more mild than it would have been otherwise.  Normal summer bleaching here may be closer to that experienced in the previous two summers, when mass bleaching of perhaps 20-30% of corals on reef slopes was followed by the death of some table corals on slopes and some staghorns and fire coral in lagoons.","Doug Fenner [dfenner@blueskynet.as] in Coral-list@coral.aoml.noaa.gov 30/3/2004 and personal communication to ReefBase.","ASM","LOW"

This led to some bleaching at a national scale, principally of the genus Acropora corals, but only in shallow waters. Shallow areas (2-4m) in which the CCC Fiji data is derived showed 5 % of coral colonies of the genus Acropora having been bleached. There was also one large area of Acropora coral at 14 m near Sunflower reef where a 15 m2 area was bleached, but only the apical portions of the colonys branches. Other than this small percent of bleached coral and the deeper bleaching at Sunflower, there appeared to be little overall impact of the bleaching in the Mamanucas for April-May 2002. Bleaching in 2002 was not nearly as significant as the bleaching event that occurred in 2000.","Walker, D., J.L. Solandt, S. Haycock, J. Taylor, S. Harding and P. Raines, 2002

2002,"Tuvalu","Funafuti Lagoon",-8.5,179.18,"For the two sites we have analyzed so far, we recorded an average 
% bleached for the most dominant coral family, Acroporidae 
(Acropora muricata, A. robusta etc), to be 70%.  Bleaching is 
equally distributed in branching and tabulate acroporas. A little less 
than 20% average cover was recorded for Pocilloporidae (e.g. 
Styllophora sp.), while Agariciidae, Faviidae and Mussidae < 10%.  
Bleaching was particularly dominant over the reef crest and slope 
habitats though, average 50% bleaching was recorded in low 
coverage of acropora colonies at the lagoon floor.  

""We recorded 30.5 deg. C average for water temperature with the 
highest being 32 deg. C.  We suspect bleaching to have been 
started end of March and April.""","Coral-list 28.05.02 - Samasoni Sauni","TUV","HIGH"
