Percentage of bleached corals was seen to range from 35 to 90% between 0 and 25m depth around the whole island. The reduction in percent corals bleached at all depths over the first year of observation was dramatic (live coral cover fell from a maximum of 80% for all depths to between 0 and 10% in 1999). Around Danjugan, these areas were dominated by colonies of branching Acropora spp. and Seriatopora hystrix. 

Initially, an average of around 80% of corals from all depths were bleached at Hilarys Reef. Corals that bleached were dominated by P. clavus in the shallow depths of Hilarys Reef. In deeper depths, more delicate plating forms such as were seen to bleach, but not as severely as the P. clavus from the 6m quadrats.Bleaching over the shallower areas was also recorded in soft coral forms (Sinularia flexibilis, other Sinularia spp. and Sarcophyton spp.).

By 21 Aug 1996 mean SST in Kaneohe Bay reached 28.5 C and was increasing rapidly. Wind speed dropped to a low level.  Solar radiation input was at near annual maximum with little cloud cover. Corals throughout the inner portion of Kaneohe Bay began to show signs of stress including contracted polyps, mucous secretion and some discoloration. Maximum mid-day temperature on the reef began to exceed 30 C starting on 26 Aug

1996. By 31 August 1996 the daily mean SST exceeded 30 C with a daily mid day maximum approaching 30.7 C.  By this time the bleaching process was conspicuously underway in corals throughout the inner portion of the bay.  Corals in the lagoon area directly in front of the main building of the Hawaii Institute of Marine Biology experienced higher temperatures due to restricted circulation and were highly bleached by 26 August 1996. Large tracts of corals throughout the inshore portion of Kaneohe Bay became highly bleached by 4 September. The areas where significant amounts of bleaching occurred were confined to the inner portion of Kaneohe Bay. The proportion of coral heads that bleached throughout the affected area varied from less than 5% in some areas to 100% over large sections of reef.  The amount of bleaching diminished near stream discharge points or other areas where turbidity was high.  Bleaching decreased with depth, especially in localized areas of high turbidity.  

The period of highest thermal stress occurred between 14 August and 5 September (22 days).  During this time period the mean daily temperature remained in the 29-30 C  range.  The corals became progressively more bleached throughout September even  though temperature was declining.  Maximum bleaching occurred from 2 to 4 weeks  after the peak of highest temperature.  A second less severe warming episode  developed in early October, but peak temperature remained below 29 C and did  not appear to further increase the rate of bleaching.  By mid October  temperatures diminished into the normal range and recovery of bleached  corals was underway.  Corals that were only slightly bleached started to regain pigmentation.  The remaining zooxanthellae in the lower shaded portions of bleached colonies began to rapidly re-infect the upper surface bleached areas.  Corals that were highly bleached died or regained pigment very slowly.

Most of the colonies throughout the bay had recovered by mid November.  Some of the highly bleached colonies  still were white in color in late November, but regained full pigment by the end of December 1996.","USA","LOW"

By mid-September bleaching was observed in a depth range of 2-46 m . Bleaching at 20 m consisted of about 25% of the reef. Bleached organisms included stony coral, gorgonians, and sponges. Bleaching continued to increase in number of colonies affected through the first week of October.  One loggerhead sponge (Spheciospongia vesparia) at 35 m, reduced in size through tissue loss in 1987, bleached again in 1990 . No further bleaching was observed in 1991 or 1992.

Type of organism affected:

Scleractinia (hard coral) Acropora cervicornis Agaricia agaricites Diploria strigosa Montastrea annularis Montastrea cavernosa Porites porites; Gorgonacea (soft coral) several unidentified species.



Coral bleaching occurred at Lee Stocking Island following a short period (18 days) of daily average water temperatures above 30 .5`C on the bank in July-August 1990 followed by another temperature peak in mid-September. A maximum temperature of 32.5C was reached on 23 September 1990 . The July monthly average for 1990 did not differ from surrounding years, but August and September were significantly wanner in 1990.

However, after high wind intensities and coastal upwelling caused further sea surface temperature reductions during autumn 1998, we observed widespread bleaching in the reef tract, but mortality only occurred in the two most northern reefs of the area: Tijera and Mazunte. Pocillopora was the most affected genus, although Pavona and Porites were impacted, too. In normal years, northern winds cross the Gulf of M_xico and increase their speed when passing through the Tehuantepec Isthmus. They displace surface water and produce strong upwellings that affect an area of about 200X500 km in the Gulf of Tehuantepec.","MEX","LOW"
