Bleaching evaluations of Pocillopora capitata were conducted by assessing  the concentrations of chlorophyll a and total carotenoids from samples along submarine transect lines.The coralline population at La Boquita is under a state of local thermal stress, which is a direct consequence of the inappropriate location of the artificial intercommunication structure of the Juluapan Lagoon, which could cause irreversible damage to the reef's productivity, adaptability and regeneration capacity.","Ms Angelica Flores Ramirez,  Universidad de Colima.",,MEX

The observations were taken in three different locations within the atoll's lagoon (no observations taken on the fore reef) during repeated benthic transects.  That genus is already found in low numbers within Glovers due to its slow recovery after Hurricane Mitch in '98 and various other bleaching events.  In an odd twist, I did some work at the Brooklyn Aquarium (WCS) in the coral culture lab in May and noted bleachingamong our Acropora samples just before I left.

No signs of bleaching were observed on Acropora cytherea. 2 small colonies of Acropora muricata about 25 cm high were completely bleached. Bleached massive coral colonies were relatively small (about 30 cm across or less). Partial bleaching was observed on massive corals. <br>In the latter half of March 2005 the temperature on land was relatively high with humidity 90% or higher. The sea surface temperature was not measured where the bleaching was observed. <br>Since 31st of March 2005 the weather on the west coast has changed to pre-monsoon. This means that there is SW winds and rain. If the rainy weather continues it might save the corals from further bleaching.Minor coral bleaching was reported from SL last year too, from Trincomalee in the East coast and Rumassala reef in the south.","Rajasuriya, A. 2005.

Twelve coral species had bleaching greater than 50%, with four species being more than 90% bleached (Diploria labrynthiformis, Agaricia spp., Mycetophyllia spp., and Montastraea annularis). <br>Several abundant corals also were severely bleached; four corals (M. annularis, D. strigosa, Porites astreoides, and Agaracia spp.) had cover greater than 9,850 cm 2 and experienced bleaching from 40 _ 95%. Fire corals (Millepora spp.) comprised 11,400 cm 2 of total cover and were bleached 60%. Acropora palmata covered 21,800 cm 2 of the sampled area but was less severely bleached (23%). <br>Some corals had bleaching less than 20% (Stephanocoenia. interceptis, Madracis spp., Dichocoenia stokesii, Meandrina meandrites), and other corals had no bleaching (Acropora cervicornis; Diploria cylindricus, Eusmilia spp., and Scolymia spp., <br>In general, the coral bleaching event was widespread and occurred all around Buck Island but with no obvious spatial patterns. Also, no spatial patterns were observed in the occurrence of bleaching for four abundant coral species. A weak but significant correlation (r 2 = 0.159, P = 0.0023) occurred between overall bleaching and depth, such that corals at shallower sites had higher rates of bleaching than those at deeper sites. If coral bleaching is temperature related, the observed correlation between depth and bleaching suggests that water temperature at depth would be lower than at the surface. However, water temperature, measured with a dive computer (Oceanic ProPlus 2) was not significantly lower at deeper sites than at shallower sites (r 2 = 0.004, P = 0.633, F = 0.230, df = 60). Overall, the water temperature ranged from 82 to 95 oF with a mean = 88.9 ± 0.19 oF (from 27.7 to 35 oC, mean = 31.6 ± 0.1 oC).<br>For more information, please refere to  http://ccma.nos.noaa.gov/products/biogeography/coral_bleaching/welcome.html","Jeffrey, C., R.

D’az et al. for Santa Marta, Colombia (fecha). In this case, however, we have not identified a mechanism such as upwelling, that helps to explain this delay between maximum temperature and bleaching. <br>Between the 23rd of September and the 4th of October of 2005, during the annual surveys of the GCRMN and CARICOMP, we examined five reefs, two oceanics, at Los Roques Archipelago National Park and three continental reefs at MNP. We surveyed more than 500 colonies between 5 and 12 m depth, and only two colonies were partially bleached (< 5% of their surface).  Sea surface temperature (SST) was30 ¡C. <br>By the end of October, SST was also 30 ¡C but we found that 21 ± 4% of the colonies (n = 5 transects) had bleached in Cayo Sombrero (CS) at MNP. Most affected species were: <br>M. franksi (50%)<br>M. faveolata (31%)<br>C. natans (15%)<br>M. meandrites (100%)<br>A. agaricites (67%) <br>hydrocorals Millepora spp (38%).<br>Of the bleached colonies, 19% were afected in < 10% of their surface, 5% were afected in 10-25% of their surface, 19% in 25-50% of their surface and 60% of the colonies were bleached in 75-100% of their surface.

Cheeca Rocks is located offshore of the middle Florida Keys and this sites are currently being monitored as part of a dissertation study on coral disease. <br>Five 16m2 permanent plots were established at each of these sites in August of 2004 and a total of 266 corals at Cheeca Rocks have been monitored for the incidence of bleaching and disease since that time.<br>On August 11th, 2005, I observed some partial bleaching affecting only a few of the monitored colonies. When I returned on August 16th, paling and partial bleaching was occurring on 19% of the monitored corals at Cheeca Rocks.  This bleaching was mainly affecting species of Colpophyllia natans and Montastrea faveolata. However, at this point all of the monitored colonies of Agaricia agaricites within the quadrats were completely bleached. <br>On September 1st, I revisited the sites to find that 74% of monitored corals at Cheeca Rocks were experiencing some extent of bleaching (paling, partial bleaching, or total colony bleaching).  The proportions of all colonies experiencing total bleaching (i.e. no observable color from zooxanthellae) were 11% at Cheeca Rocks.  <br>Species most affected by the bleaching were C. natans, M. faveolata, and A. agaricites.  Other species found bleaching included M. annularis, M. cavernosa, Dichocoenia stokesii, Diploria clivosa, D. strigosa, D. labrynthiformis, Favia fragum, Meandrina meandrites, Mussa angulosa, Porites astreoides, P. porites, Siderastrea radians, S. siderea, and Stephanocoenia intersepta.  Species other than scleractinian corals observed to be bleaching included Millepora alcicornis, M. complanata, Palythoa caribaeorum, Erythropodium caribaeorum, Briareum asbestinum, and some other gorgonians. The only notable exception was individuals of Mycetophyllia spp. which appeared healthy and experienced no noticeable bleaching.<br>Water temperature was recorded during each site visit with a YSI-30 atdepths of 1 meter and 5 meters from the surface.

Coral Gardens is located offshore of the middle Florida Keys and this sites are currently being monitored as part of a dissertation study on coral disease. Five 16m2 permanent plots were established at each of these sites in August of 2004 and a total of 350 corals at Coral Gardens have been monitored for the incidence of bleaching and disease since that time.<br>On August 11th, 2005, I observed some partial bleaching affecting only a few of the monitored colonies. When I returned on August 16th, paling and partial bleaching was occurring on 33% of the monitored corals at Coral Gardens.  This bleaching was mainly affecting species of Colpophyllia natans and Montastrea faveolata. However, at this point all of the monitored colonies of Agaricia agaricites within the quadrats were completely bleached. <br>On September 1st, I revisited the sites to find that 80% of monitored corals at Coral Gardens were experiencing some extent of bleaching (paling, partial bleaching, or total colony bleaching).  The proportions of all colonies experiencing total bleaching (i.e. no observable color from zooxanthellae) were 15% at Coral Gardens.  Species most affected by the bleaching were C. natans, M. faveolata, and A. agaricites.  Other species found bleaching included M. annularis, M. cavernosa, Dichocoenia stokesii, Diploria clivosa, D. strigosa, D. labrynthiformis, Favia fragum, Meandrina meandrites, Mussa angulosa, Porites astreoides, P. porites, Siderastrea radians, S. siderea, and Stephanocoenia intersepta.  Species other than scleractinian coralsobserved to be bleaching included Millepora alcicornis, M. complanata,Palythoa caribaeorum, Erythropodium caribaeorum, Briareum asbestinum, and some other gorgonians.

Algal blooms were extensive in patches of staghorn acroporids 0.5-2m depth at upper slope. These were severely bleached in 1998. Bleaching was in 'recovery' phase, i.e. Bleached colonies were recovering their color, measured photosynthetic yeilds were reduced compared to unbleached corals, but were not as low as in bleached corals (Fv/Fm 0.4-0.65).

I was there on holidays during the weekend of 8-10 July and took many photos in shallow waters (down to 5 m) around the Oceanarium at San Mart’n de Pajarales Island (10¡10'37.7""N-75¡46'16.2""). Resident people had been noticing the bleaching since about 1-2 weeks before my arrival, associated with extremely warm, and possibly quite brackish waters (from nearby river discharges).<br>Almost all corals were totally white to pale yellow. Some massive star coral colonies (Montastraea annularis and M. faveolata) still had slightly colored basal patches. Brain coral species (Diploria and Colpophyllia) were completely bleached. Porites porites beds were totally white. P. astreoides knobs were from white to light lemon yellow. Siderastrea siderea was less affected with a dark bluish-violet color in several colonies, and a few normally brown. S. radians was apparently not affected (hard to tell, the small encrustations of this species being normally so light). Even Favia fragum golfball corals were fully bleached. Benthic, rubble-dwelling anemones (probably corallymorpharians) were white. Millepora spp. had both white, normal and ""pinto"" (patchy) like colonies-branches. Did not see any Acropora to tell whether the few remaining colonies bleached or not.<br>It seemed that deeper corals were less bleached. However, Jaime Rojas, biologist working for both the National Park authorities and the Oceanarium, undertook on July 8 a quick survey around the islands confirming that the phenomenon is widespread.

By 21 Aug 1996 mean SST in Kaneohe Bay reached 28.5 C and was increasing rapidly. Wind speed dropped to a low level.  Solar radiation input was at near annual maximum with little cloud cover. Corals throughout the inner portion of Kaneohe Bay began to show signs of stress including contracted polyps, mucous secretion and some discoloration. Maximum mid-day temperature on the reef began to exceed 30 C starting on 26 Aug1996. By 31 August 1996 the daily mean SST exceeded 30 C with a daily mid day maximum approaching 30.7 C.  By this time the bleaching process was conspicuously underway in corals throughout the inner portion of the bay.  Corals in the lagoon area directly in front of the main building of the Hawaii Institute of Marine Biology experienced higher temperatures due to restricted circulation and were highly bleached by 26 August 1996. Large tracts of corals throughout the inshore portion of Kaneohe Bay became highly bleached by 4 September. The areas where significant amounts of bleaching occurred were confined to the inner portion of Kaneohe Bay. The proportion of coral heads that bleached throughout the affected area varied from less than 5% in some areas to 100% over large sections of reef.  The amount of bleaching diminished near stream discharge points or other areas where turbidity was high.  Bleaching decreased with depth, especially in localized areas of high turbidity.  The period of highest thermal stress occurred between 14 August and 5 September (22 days).  During this time period the mean daily temperature remained in the 29-30 C  range.  The corals became progressively more bleached throughout September even  though temperature was declining.  Maximum bleaching occurred from 2 to 4 weeks  after the peak of highest temperature.  A second less severe warming episode  developed in early October, but peak temperature remained below 29 C and did  not appear to further increase the rate of bleaching.  By mid October  temperatures diminished into the normal range and recovery of bleached  corals was underway.  Corals that were only slightly bleached started to regain pigmentation.  The remaining zooxanthellae in the lower shaded portions of bleached colonies began to rapidly re-infect the upper surface bleached areas.  Corals that were highly bleached died or regained pigment very slowly.Most of the colonies throughout the bay had recovered by mid November.  Some of the highly bleached colonies  still were white in color in late November, but regained full pigment by the end of December 1996.","Jokiel, P.L. personal communication to  NOAA & ReefBase (18/7/2003)",,USA_HAW

From April 4 in Kiunga, bleaching was first observed and reported widely.  Following that, pale, partially bleached and some fully bleached corals were reported widely throughout Kenya. Bleaching is mild to moderate rather than severe; colonies are ÔpalingÕ, and all shades of colour from normal to white are observed. In Kenya, most paling and bleaching is on upper surfaces, and the coincidence of high temperatures, calm conditions and spring low tides just prior to bleaching suggest combined effects of these factors rather than an overwhelming dominance of one.The spatial extent of paling and bleaching amounts to perhaps 10-20% of coral cover and 5-25% or colonies, with most observations made in shallow inner-reef zones (water depth of 0.3-1m at MLW).  Most detail on taxonomic incidence of bleaching has come from reports in Kenya, where the most affected genus is Pocillopora, where locally close to 100% of colonies have been observed bleached, and some colonies observed with dead patches (primarily around the branch tips). Interestingly, P. damicornis is less affected than other species, and in one shallow reef flat area is unaffected.

The extent of this bleaching has been severe with many reef sites showing bleaching levels of 90 to 100% across all coral species. These sites were all shallow-water reefs no deeper than 12 meters. The bleaching began in mid-April and reached its peak about 3-4 weeks ago when the water temperatures increased by at least 2??C, bringing surface water temperatures up to 34??C and over. The  start  of  the  rainy  season  last week has brought cooler water temperatures but has also resulted in heavy sedimentation levels, smothering and  killing  off  many of the bleached colonies. Acropora spp. And D. Heliopora colonies have been hit particularly hard but there are some large Porites colonies which seem to be coping with the unusual conditions. With water temperatures dropping back to 31??C, we are hoping to see some colour returning to Cambodia???s reefs! If you would like further information and images of the bleaching event, feel  free to get in touch with me directly or contact Vicki Bush, the Project Scientist in Cambodia at [1]cambodia at coralcay.org.  We will also be presenting our monitoring results at the 2^nd Asia-Pacific Coral Reef Symposium in Phuket later this month.",[Coral list] From: jvb at coralcay.org (Jan-Willem van Bochove),,KHM

In Kenya, most paling and bleaching is on upper surfaces, and the coincidence of high temperatures, calm conditions and spring low tides just prior to bleaching suggest combined effects of these factors rather than an overwhelming dominance of one.The spatial extent of paling and bleaching amounts to perhaps 10-20% of coral cover and 5-25% or colonies, with most observations made in shallow inner-reef zones (water depth of 0.3-1m at MLW).Most detail on taxonomic incidence of bleaching has come from reports in Kenya, where the most affected genus is Pocillopora, where locally close to 100% of colonies have been observed bleached, and some colonies observed with dead patches (primarily around the branch tips). Interestingly, P. damicornis is less affected than other species, and in one shallow reef flat area is unaffected.

But it recovered year by year, at this year, the live hard coral percentage come back to 70%. This recovery of hard coral percentage means hard coral in this area grow up well and the environment for hard coral keeps good. And other reason, main stream of the Kuroshio current, major warm current in western Pacific ocean, stays near shore of Kii peninsula in a last few years, so the seawater temperature in winter keeps not so cold. This 70% of live hard coral percentage is very good to compare to Okinawa area, the hard coral in Okinawa got major damage in a few years. We found many Drupella spp. in last survey, but this year, we cound not found them at the transect and near it, so we think an influence of these shell is not so high now. However, we have to note shell damage in the future. We found many tropical fishes like a kind of Pomacentridae species, they are not original indicator in RC but we choose some of them for additional indicator, we think one of the reason is the warm current stay near the shore. We found no major change in invertebrate survey.""We think the hard coral in this area will become good to 2004 level in next year if it will be not so cold, no typhoon and no eaten trace by shells or COTS, because the tabler type hard coral recover well. But we need to remember many coral died in 2004-2005 winter and it necessary for 4 years to recover it.

In Kenya, most paling and bleaching is on upper surfaces, and the coincidence of high temperatures, calm conditions and spring low tides just prior to bleaching suggest combined effects of these factors rather than an overwhelming dominance of one.The spatial extent of paling and bleaching amounts to perhaps 10-20% of coral cover and 5-25% or colonies, with most observations made in shallow inner-reef zones (water depth of 0.3-1m at MLW).  Bleaching was also recorded at 12-15m on the fore reef slope off Mombasa, though at lower levels of <5%, and to milder levels than in shallow water.Most detail on taxonomic incidence of bleaching has come from reports in Kenya, where the most affected genus is Pocillopora, where locally close to 100% of colonies have been observed bleached, and some colonies observed with dead patches (primarily around the branch tips). Interestingly, P. damicornis is less affected than other species, and in one shallow reef flat area is unaffected. After Pocillopora, the most strongly affected genera include Porites, Echinopora, Galaxea and partially affected genera include Platygyra, Acropora, Montipora, various faviids and fungiids, Pavona.From repeated surveys in the Mombasa area in April/May, it appears that the incidence of bleaching is not increasing, and it remains to be seen to what extent colonies recover or die.  From temperature logger data for Mombasa, the bleaching was only observed at the end of the temperature plateau around April 10, and since then water temperatures have steadily declined.","David OburaCoral-list@coral.aoml.noaa.gov 5/8/2003",,KEN

Larger colonies (30CM diameter) more likely to be affected then small colonies and single branches. Bleaching accompanied by white band disease in four colonies. (A. cervicornis is relatively rare. <20 colonies observed total). <br>Agaricia agaricites: Bleaching observed on colony ridges, patchy. Less then 20 individuals observed displaying notable bleaching in this locally common species.  <br>Porites porites: Bleaching observed as fading of colour on upper faces of branches and growth tips in four colonies, all of the brown morph. This species and morph is common.<br>Palythoa caribaeorum: one colony observed to be partially bleached, colours faded on its upper surface. This species is uncommon in this area.

As of 10/29/05, over 95% of A. formosa in Nuuuli pool, Tutuila, American Samoa are partly bleached.  Mike King reports similar bleaching in Alofau pool, Tutuila.  They recovered from the previous summer's bleaching just 5 months ago.<br>Some have suggested that due to rising temperatures from global warming, in the future coral reefs may bleach every summer.  This is already happening in the pools of American Samoa.  Because it is a regular, annual event, and there are several possible controls, this offers an opportunity for scientists to plan studies of bleaching instead of having to take advantage of unpredictable opportunities.<br>For the past two Austral summers, I have recorded the bleaching of three species of staghorn Acropora  (A. formosa, A. pulchra, and A. nobilis) in the fringing reef pools of Tutuila, American Samoa.  Acopora formosa and Porites cylindrica dominate the pools of Tutuila, but P. cylindrica was not observed to bleach.  Bleaching of the three staghorns has reached as high as 100 percent of the colonies in some of the pools, with colonies nearly entirely white.  At the same time, very few corals on the outer reef slopes were observed bleaching.  Acropora nobilis is present on the outer slopes (though not common), and did not bleach there when the same species strongly bleached in the pools.  The pools reach higher temperatures than on the outer slopes.  Most of the pools had peak temperatures of 32-33 oC in the last summer, but one hit a peak of 34.9 oC (for a half hour).  The highest temperatures occur on sunny summer days when low tide is midday, reducing circulation.  High temperatures are well known in the pools of nearby Ofu island, American Samoa (Craig, Birkeland, and Belliveau, 2001).  Those pools have a higher diversity of corals and less bleaching.<br>Mass coral bleaching on outer reef slopes was observed by several people in American Samoa in 2002 and 2003, though the time and intensity were not recorded.  At present, about half of all staghorn colonies in the pools are dead.  Essentially none have died in the past two years, so it is likely they died in 2002 and/or 2003, when bleaching was more intense.  Thus, along with the present bleaching, staghorns in the pools have bleached for five years in a row. <br>    In 2004, staghorns in the pools began to bleach in March, peaked in April, and ended in August.  Bleaching started again in November (04), peaked in the January to April (05) period, and ended at the end of May (05).  Now bleaching has started again at the end of October (05).  Pool staghorns are spending more of the year bleached than recovered, year after year.","Douglas Fenner, Dept. of Marine & Wildlife Resources, American Samoa (Douglas Fenner [dfenner@blueskynet.as] in Coral list 11/8/2005",,ASM

Many of the RKC and HC are mushroom corals, which seem to have increased in number at this depth compared to previous monitoring. The sand is mainly borderline sand/silt, but sand component larger, unlike the 3m where the silt component is dominant. Sponge includes many branching tubular sponges which have increased, as well as massive sponges. Soft coral has decreased. Most COTs off-transect/belt were near segments 3 and 4, seems that segments 1 and 2 have been pretty much totallt predated causing a shift in the COTs population to areas with remaining HC cover. Many COTs outside transect also, including a group of 15 individuals around 1 massive coral about 30cm diameter. COTs attack main cause of coral death and subsequent breaking to rubble. No trash unlike previous visit, maybe because seaweed farming has moved slightly and because fishing is now rare at this site, due to poor returns.

Some typical of COTs, although none seen on transect, many on nearby mainland reefs. Attractive seascape but very very few fish. Suspect much of the rubble is from the shallower depths where bomb damage is severe, mostly fragments of branching corals, dominated by Acropora, amount of rubble is far more than could be provided by the amount of live branching forms. Some dead coral not obvious poison or disease, but sosial survey indicates high level of cyanide use, and no coloured dividing line so concluded damage was cyadine rather than disease.

By mid-September bleaching was observed in a depth range of 2-46 m . Bleaching at 20 m consisted of about 25% of the reef. Bleached organisms included stony coral, gorgonians, and sponges. Bleaching continued to increase in number of colonies affected through the first week of October.  One loggerhead sponge (Spheciospongia vesparia) at 35 m, reduced in size through tissue loss in 1987, bleached again in 1990 . No further bleaching was observed in 1991 or 1992.Type of organism affected:Porifera (sponge) Aplysina spp .

A maximum temperature of 32.5C was reached on 23 September 1990 . The July monthly average for 1990 did not differ from surrounding years, but August and September were significantly wanner in 1990.

4324,Americas,Northern Caribbean,Bahamas,San Salvador,23.9994,-74.5575,11,2005,,-1,No Bleaching,"During the week of November 20th, 2005, an Earthwatch Institute Research Team ""The Bahamian Reef Survey"" discovered a bleaching event in progress on patch reefs around San Salvador, Bahamas. The bleaching was evident primarily on Agaricia sp., Favia fragum, and Porites sp. (finger corals) - although Porites asteroids, had limited bleaching. Limited bleaching of Montastrea annularis was also observed; however, many coral heads of this species displayed significant blanching. Water quality testing showed physical and chemical parameters were within normal levels at the time.The Bahamian Reef Survey has collected data since 1992, on the shallow patch reefs surrounding the Island. This bleaching event is the third bleaching event documented on San Salvador in that time period. Initially the data suggest that the bleaching event is similar to a 1995/96 bleaching event in both scope and affected species. While no proximal cause was found for the earlier event, it appears that higher than normal sea temperatures have been involved in precipitating this event.",John Rollino [John.Rollino@earthtech.com] in Coral list 12/1/2005,,BHS
7288,Americas,Northern Caribbean,Bahamas,San Salvador,24.1,-74.483333,,2010,,-1,HIGH," Earthwatch Institute research-team conducted seasonal monitoring on shallow-water patch reefs on San Salvador Island, Bahamas. Results of the monitoring determined the majority Agaricia agaricites colonies were showing signs of bleaching - with many colonies exhibiting bleaching of greater than 75 percent. Also, as part of a reef restoration experiment, many Acropora palmata transplants suffered mortality since the project's last monitoring effort in July.  Prior to July, most of the transplants had survived over one year and had exhibited new tissue growth. Review of temperature logger data showed water temperatures >30C  in August. Finally, and somewhat curiously, much less algae was observed on the reefs than in previous monitoring efforts and large corals (e.g., Diploria sp., Montastrea sp., etc.) exhibited little, if any, ill effects.Anecdotal reports from residents on the island indicated that air temperatures in August were the hottest that anyone could remember.Also, for the last two months there have been excessive winds with the elevations of both high and low tides being far greater (and sustained) than anyone could ever remember","[Coral List ] : Rollino, John.

However, after high wind intensities and coastal upwelling caused further sea surface temperature reductions during autumn 1998, we observed widespread bleaching in the reef tract, but mortality only occurred in the two most northern reefs of the area: Tijera and Mazunte. Pocillopora was the most affected genus, although Pavona and Porites were impacted, too. In normal years, northern winds cross the Gulf of M_xico and increase their speed when passing through the Tehuantepec Isthmus. They displace surface water and produce strong upwellings that affect an area of about 200X500 km in the Gulf of Tehuantepec.","Reyes-Bonilla, et al 2002.

6877,Americas,Eastern Caribbean,Trinidad and Tobago,Tobago reef,11,-60,,2010,20-60 ft,-1,HIGH,"As a follow up to my pervious post on ""Coral bleaching and an unknown sponge disease in Tobago"", I returned to a monitoring site, surveyed only 10 dys earlier, and I to my dismay, within the 20-40ft depth area there is mass mortality of the Giant Barrel Sponges (Xestospongia muta).  Some of the other songes are also looking a bit poorly, but not to the extent of mortality.  Samples have been retrieved for analysis both heathy and unhealthy looking X. muta.  That said, even heathy looking sponges were snapping off at their bases.  There is also wide spread bleaching, especially at the 23-35ft depth at Speyside, affecting most species(Montastrea faviolata, Siderastrea sidera, S. radians, all Diplorias, M.Anularis, Millipora, octocorals etc). Speyside's reefs are generally spongedominated, but the main reef building coral species are Montastreafaveolata, Siderastrea sidera, Diploria spp. And Madracis mirabilis.  Atdeeper depths, up to 60ft moderate bleaching was observed, and only ofparticular species (Meandrina meandrities and Siderastrea sidera).  Thewater temperature at this depth was quite warm, with temperature loggersrecording on the reefs at 30ft showing temperatures up to 31 deg C. Interestingly some resiliency studies/models indicate that the longer livedand slower growing species, such as boulder corals (Montastreas andSiderastrea) are more resilient that branching species (Porities andMadracis), however very very little bleaching of M. mirabilis was observed. M. mirabilis can be found in extensive spreads in Speyside with octocorals,sponges, boulder and brain corals inter-dispersed.Thus far the north eastern side of the island is the only location I've beenable to follow up on, but I have received reports of increased bleachingalong the Caribbean coast and south west of the island.Jahson Alemu ICoral Reef Ecologist","[Coral list] Jahson AlemuCoral Reef Ecologist",,TTO

4000,Pacific,Micronesia,American Samoa,Tutuila Lagoons,-14.284,-170.674,3,2004,,1,LOW,"A mild coral bleaching event is currently underway in American Samoa.  About 1/4 to 3/4 of living staghorns are at least partially bleached in 3 lagoons on Tutuila.  Only upper surfaces of horizontal branches have any bleaching (usually it is only partial even on upper surfaces); undersides always retain some color.  No colonies are totally bleached, none recently dead.  A few A. palifera and A. cf. listeri are bleached, but there are very few colonies of these species in the lagoons.  Other species are not bleached.  Bleaching was first seen on March 20.  The last previous check of these corals was on Feb 28.     Temperature loggers in one lagoon show temperatures rising to a peak averaging a little over 30C in mid-February, and remaining fairly steady since then.  Peak temperatures reach 32C for a few hours on some days.  These 3 lagoons have little water circulating into them at low tide.  25-75% of staghorns in the more closed lagoons are bleached.  Similar areas with the same staghorns that have open circulation with the ocean have very little bleaching (about 1-5%).  Reef fronts that have been looked at also have no bleaching, but do not have these staghorns.    I am told that last year there was strong bleaching of the staghorns, and there was bleaching in the previous summer as well.Records from temperature loggers show that the sea surface temperature in American Samoa was heating up in December and early January.  When Hurricane Heta hit on Jan 6, 2004 it caused a sudden large drop in sea surface temperatures, most likely due to wave mixing of surface waters with cooler deeper water.  After Jan 6, sea surface temperature began to warm again, starting at a new lower base.  So in effect, Hurricane Heta reset the summer warming of surface waters.  Presumably then the maximum temperatures that were reached were lower than they would have been otherwise, and bleaching was more mild than it would have been otherwise.  Normal summer bleaching here may be closer to that experienced in the previous two summers, when mass bleaching of perhaps 20-30% of corals on reef slopes was followed by the death of some table corals on slopes and some staghorns and fire coral in lagoons.",Doug Fenner [dfenner@blueskynet.as] in Coral-list@coral.aoml.noaa.gov 30/3/2004 and personal communication to ReefBase.,,ASM
